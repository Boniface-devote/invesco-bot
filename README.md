# Invesco PDF Certificate Extractor

A Flask web application that extracts data from PDF certificates and can automatically fill forms on the Invesco website.

## Features

- **PDF Data Extraction**: Extracts data from both Normal and AD certificates
- **Client-Side Form Filling**: Opens Invesco form in user's browser with step-by-step instructions
- **One-Click Copy**: Copy individual fields or all data to clipboard
- **Cloud Deployment**: Ready for deployment on Railway
- **Data Export**: Download extracted data as JSON
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Edge WebDriver (for form filling functionality)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=your-email@example.com
   PASSWORD=your-password
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Railway Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Railway account
- GitHub repository with your code

### Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to Railway**:
   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   In Railway dashboard, go to your project â†’ Variables tab and add:
   ```
   RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
   FLASK_ENV=production
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=your-email@example.com
   PASSWORD=your-password
   LOGIN_URL=https://www.invesco-ug.com/auth/login
   TARGET_URL=https://www.invesco-ug.com/business/application/new
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   - Railway will automatically detect the Python application
   - The deployment will use the `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`
   - Your app will be available at the provided Railway URL

### Important Notes for Railway

- **Client-Side Form Filling**: The form filling now works by opening the user's browser with instructions
- **Data Extraction**: PDF data extraction works perfectly on Railway
- **User-Friendly**: Step-by-step instructions guide users through the form filling process
- **No Server Dependencies**: Form filling runs entirely on the user's machine

## Usage

1. **Upload PDF**: Select a certificate PDF file
2. **Extract Data**: Click "Extract" to process the PDF
3. **View Results**: Review the extracted data in the table
4. **Fill Form**: 
   - Click "ðŸš€ Open Invesco Form" to open the form in your browser
   - Click "ðŸ“‹ Show Instructions" for step-by-step guidance
   - Use "Copy" buttons to copy individual field values
   - Use "ðŸ“‹ Copy All Data" to copy all data at once
5. **Download Data**: Click "ðŸ’¾ Download Data" to save extracted data as JSON

### Form Filling Process

1. **Open Form**: Click "ðŸš€ Open Invesco Form" - this opens the Invesco website in a new tab

## Troubleshooting

### Local Development
- Ensure Edge WebDriver is in the project directory
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify PDF files are valid and readable

### Railway Deployment
